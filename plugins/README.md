## Plugins ##
In this folder you will find plugins made for the bootstrapper.  
You can run them via the ``--plugin`` option when bootstrapping:  
```
./ec2debian-build-ami --plugin plugins/ec2-run-user-data
```

* ``ec2-run-user-data``  
  This adds the ``ec2-run-user-data`` script to the init scripts. Anything in the userdata field will be executed by this script.
* ``standard-packages``  
  Adds some common packages to the AMI.
* ``unattended-upgrades``  
  Enables unattended upgrades with aptitude. Your EC2 server will upgrade itself daily.
* ``ec2-user``  
  Creates a user named 'ec2-user', gives it sudo rights and disables the root login.
* ``remount``  
  Remounts the bootstrapped volume.
  With this plugin you can inspect the results of the bootstrapping process without launching an instance.
